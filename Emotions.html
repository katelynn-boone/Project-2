Dogs can tell if your happy, sad, or in pain.  Their natural instinct is to comfort their owners.  Dogs
form an emotional connection with their owners and they want them to be happy.  Dogs have an ability to read 
your emotion.  So when your sad they will always come to comfort you.  When you are hurt they will always protect 
you.  And when you are happy they will be happy with you.
